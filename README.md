## Project Specification and Background
[Project Spec and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html)

This application was developed for the [Turing School of Software and Design's](https://frontend.turing.edu/) Module 3. The project was designed to build and test competency in the fundamentals of React, creating multi-page React web applications using Router, and implementing end-to-end testing using Cypress.

## Features
The app presents users with a dashboard of movies pulled from an API of movie data. Users are then able to select specific movies to view further details about them and their trailers.

## Wins and Challanges

### Wins:
- Worked quickly and efficiently as an asynchronous team by establishing and adhering to robust communication and working norms, completing all project deliverables ahead of schedule and giving each team member sufficient time to practice the many new topics involved.
- Sucessfully redesigning the app to use React Router to provide a multi-page UX.
- Deepened the groups' understanding of React fundamentals, particularly component architecture and using props.

### Challenges:
- Refactoring the code to replace the original, conditional rendering logic with React Router to create a multi-page UX initially proved difficult. Stepping back and reviewing the structure of our components and how data was flowing between them was particularly helpful in resolving this challenge.
